# Unity Production Convergence 80H Campaign Ledger

This file is the chronological source of campaign history. Read
`UNITY-PRODUCTION-CONVERGENCE-80H-HANDOFF.md` for the exact current state and
the next action.

## Campaign mandate

- Started: 2026-08-20
- Target duration: approximately 80 wall-clock hours
- TypeScript is the sole authoritative simulation engine.
- Unity is the production visual and interaction client.
- Three.js remains preserved as a working regression oracle, reference client,
  visual-design donor, and fallback.
- The engine bake-off is closed. This campaign must not reopen it.

## Frozen starting authorities

| Authority | Repository / branch | SHA | Verified 2026-08-20 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current game | `/Users/bruce/The Movies - Visual Spike`, `visual-tycoon-conversion-spike` | `737bbe1f37586552a1dc55c4e82b614e57dfc2f2` | Local and remote match; worktree has pre-existing untracked screenshot directories |
| TypeScript adoption proof | `adoption/current-game-unity-gate-ts` | `f6606ac9db67dc70b12a7d247d74206571d12d2c` | Local and remote match; authority worktree clean |
| Unity adoption proof | `adoption/current-game-unity-gate-client` | `d970b81c2b17383ee71c3c66a5622ecc140473b3` | Local and remote match; authority worktree clean |
| Architecture decision | `docs/unity-production-client-decision` | `82c9486a6ce3a849d72c7f7f5258d6392cc3483a` | Local and remote match; direct child of TypeScript adoption proof |

The architecture decision adds only
`docs/UNITY-PRODUCTION-CLIENT-DECISION.md`. The campaign TypeScript branch was
created and first pushed from `f6606ac9`, then fast-forwarded to the exact
decision authority `82c9486a` so every replacement agent has the mandated boot
document.

## Campaign worktrees

| Side | Worktree | Branch | Starting SHA | Remote |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript | `/Users/bruce/The Movies - Unity Production Convergence 80H` | `campaign/unity-production-convergence-80h-ts` | `f6606ac9db67dc70b12a7d247d74206571d12d2c` | `hspector-github` |
| Unity | `/Users/bruce/Project Studio - Unity Production Convergence 80H` | `campaign/unity-production-convergence-80h-client` | `d970b81c2b17383ee71c3c66a5622ecc140473b3` | `origin` |

Both branches were pushed immediately on 2026-08-20. No protected branch was
rewritten, merged, rebased, or force-pushed.

## Phase status

| Phase | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Campaign setup and baseline | Complete | Authorities verified, isolated branches pushed, full baseline built, played, captured, and measured |
| A - Productionize TypeScript to Unity contract | Active | A1 is the current acceptance gate; generated DTO protection is not yet implemented |
| B - Durable local game runtime | Untouched | Current server is a fixed-port, manually launched, in-memory experiment |
| C - Unity client architecture | Untouched | Existing spike layers have been inventoried only |
| D - Full Movie journey in Unity | Partial at inherited baseline | Automated native Movie #2 path passes, but the interaction surface remains proof-oriented and does not yet provide the approved professional retained workspaces |
| E - Lot interaction / construction / management | Partial at inherited baseline | TypeScript construction intent and visible construction state pass; direct build placement interaction is not productionized in Unity |
| F - Hero Soundstage 7 | Partial at inherited baseline | Exterior and inspectable interior exist; interior is visually bare and lacks an operating production company |
| G - Characters and authored animation | Partial at inherited baseline | Provenance-cleared assets, Mecanim setup, 32 animators, and seven active people exist; quality and role activity are below target |
| H - Purposeful people / NavMesh | Partial at inherited baseline | Seven visible people are active on NavMesh; 25/50/100 stress gates are untouched |
| I - Camera / occlusion / inspection | Partial at inherited baseline | Tycoon camera and judging cameras exist; professional interaction QA is untouched |
| J - World / era / campus quality | Partial at inherited baseline | Campus scale reads; surroundings, density, hills, and 1948 specificity remain weak |
| K - Materials / lighting / VFX / audio | Partial at inherited baseline | URP presentation exists; prototype surfaces and sparse soundstage lighting dominate |
| L - Performance / scalability | Baseline only | M3 Max measurements captured; no 25/50/100 scalability campaign yet |
| M - Resilience | Partial at inherited baseline | Stale command and save/load pass; restart, outage, malformed schema, and missing-asset matrix is incomplete |
| N - Professional QA | Baseline only | Full TypeScript, Unity EditMode, native build, native Movie #2, and runtime capture gates established |

## 2026-08-20 - Checkpoint 0: branch creation and architecture boot

### Work completed

- Verified all four frozen authorities locally and against GitHub.
- Created and pushed `campaign/unity-production-convergence-80h-ts` from
  `f6606ac9db67dc70b12a7d247d74206571d12d2c`.
- Created and pushed `campaign/unity-production-convergence-80h-client` from
  `d970b81c2b17383ee71c3c66a5622ecc140473b3`.
- Fast-forwarded only the new TypeScript campaign branch to the immutable
  architecture-decision commit `82c9486a6ce3a849d72c7f7f5258d6392cc3483a`
  and pushed it.
- Preserved dirty historical worktrees without touching their unrelated
  untracked material.

### Decisions

- Campaign work happens only in the two new sibling worktrees.
- The architecture decision commit is part of the campaign branch because the
  boot protocol requires its document and it is an exact direct descendant of
  the requested TypeScript branch point.
- Existing Three.js code and authorities remain untouched.

## 2026-08-20 - Checkpoint 1: reproducible baseline

### TypeScript validation

Run from `/Users/bruce/The Movies - Unity Production Convergence 80H`:

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm ci` | Passed; 200 packages installed. npm reports 6 dependency advisories: 3 moderate, 2 high, 1 critical. No forced audit mutation was attempted. |
| `npm test` | Passed: 324 files, 4,409 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed, 64.78 seconds |
| `npm run typecheck` | Passed |
| `npm run typecheck:bridge` | Passed |
| `npm run build` | Passed in 6.31 seconds; Vite reports existing large-chunk warnings |
| `npm run test:bridge` | Passed: 8/8 in 10.93 seconds |
| `npm run proof:bridge` | Passed during audit; Movie #2 released at Week 22; canonical save bytes 251,936 |

Bridge schema at baseline:
`sha256:3cd9be425ab45f6ea75e257bd6011ea41b3571d5aaf6d7f83d7a8980922b411e`.

The bridge suite proves exact Movie #2 identity, same-title safety, stale/forged
identity rejection, session and revision protection, save/load, fresh-session
reconnect reconstruction, byte-identical bridge/headless saves, polling
neutrality, and failed-intent save neutrality.

### Unity validation

Run from `/Users/bruce/Project Studio - Unity Production Convergence 80H` with
Unity `6000.3.22f1`:

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| EditMode run 1 | Passed 11/11. Fresh Library import logged 24 transient glTFast bone-weight job-safety failures for shared character GLBs. |
| Native macOS build | Passed, `Build Finished, Result: Success`, 131 MB app on disk |
| Native Movie #2 proof | Passed; report status `complete`, exact Movie #2 released Week 22 at revision 23 |
| Save/load in native proof | Passed; saved and restored digest both `5543ef56db8fec0df43f1a8e02548b84d77d393b71dea9cd33659614804cc5ee` |
| Stale intent in native proof | Rejected with `STALE_REVISION`; authoritative digest and revision unchanged |
| EditMode run 2 | Passed 11/11 with zero repeated asset-import failures |
| Runtime console scan | No native proof or runtime-evidence error/exception lines |

The initial import upgraded `Assets/Settings/Mobile_RPAsset.asset` from URP asset
serialization version 12 to 13. The deterministic upgrade and an ignored local
`Evidence/` root were accepted in Unity commit
`75706567fa9895892a88310a494158069b70aeda` and pushed. This prevents a clean
campaign worktree from remaining dirty after the first editor run.

### Native Movie #2 evidence

- Report:
  `/Users/bruce/Project Studio - Unity Production Convergence 80H/Evidence/Baseline/Unity-Bridge/bridge-client-proof.json`
- Screenshots:
  `/Users/bruce/Project Studio - Unity Production Convergence 80H/Evidence/Baseline/Unity-Bridge/01-whole-lot.png`
  through `11-movie-2-released.png`
- Movie title: `The Reluctant Cornerstone`
- Screenplay ID: `script-0001`
- Production ID: `prod-0013`
- Final digest:
  `429b88d5538e44839a7cfa78acc244e8a17f435a1064f9f66ea75b522203ed13`
- Final snapshot payload: 18,498 bytes
- TypeScript serialization: 17.59 ms in the final sampled response
- Unity JSON parse: 0.21 ms
- Unity snapshot apply: 0.30 ms
- Command round trip: 24.71 ms
- Native proof average: 120.0 FPS

### Runtime performance baseline

Evidence:
`/Users/bruce/Project Studio - Unity Production Convergence 80H/Evidence/Baseline/Runtime/PerformanceCaptures/Unity/runtime-performance.json`.

Same-device reference: Apple M3 Max, 1920x1080 windowed, PC URP quality, 8-second
warmup, 10-second sample.

| Metric | Baseline |
| --- | ---: |
| Average FPS | 119.82 |
| Average frame time | 8.35 ms |
| Median frame time | 8.32 ms |
| p95 frame time | 9.06 ms |
| Maximum sampled frame | 28.71 ms |
| Average draw calls | 680.04 |
| Average batches | 359.80 |
| Average set-pass calls | 85.93 |
| Average rendered triangles | 168,041 |
| Active mesh triangles in scene | 4,407,650 |
| Process working set | 412,106,752 bytes |
| Visible people | 7 |
| Visible vehicles | 10 |
| Active NavMesh agents on mesh | 7/7 active; 7/32 total components |

The report warns that only 7 of 32 NavMeshAgent components were active on the
mesh. This matches the seven authoritative visible people at this snapshot, but
the future 25/50/100 stress gates must verify scaling behavior.

### Visual baseline critique

Inspected captures:

- `A-Whole-Lot.png`
- `B-Active-Stage.png`
- `C-Construction.png`
- `D-Human-Production-Close.png`
- Movie #2 whole-lot, construction, blocker, and release captures

Self-grade, 1 to 10:

| Criterion | Score | Evidence-based critique |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| The Movies identity | 5 | Studio campus, gates, stages, and departments read; the living filmmaking fantasy is weak |
| Professional tycoon readability | 5 | Campus organization and construction silhouette read; Movie controls remain a debug/proof panel |
| Campus scale | 6 | Multiple large stages, roads, gate, backlot, departments, and surrounding blocks establish scale |
| Era identity | 5 | Deco forms, signage, vehicles, palms, and palette suggest mid-century Hollywood; surroundings and wardrobe do not carry enough period specificity |
| Buildings | 5 | Exterior silhouettes are coherent but simple, clean, and materially flat |
| People | 2 | Seven people exist but are visually absent or tiny in key captures; no strong body/role readability |
| Animation | 3 | Mecanim/NavMesh motion exists, but authored production actions are not visible in the judging frames |
| Filmmaking activity | 2 | Active-stage capture shows a bare living-room set with no camera, boom, dolly, lights, grip gear, or crew |
| Materials / lighting | 4 | Readable stylized palette, but surfaces are flat and the stage interior is underlit and empty |
| Camera | 5 | Useful overview and judging cameras exist; production focus does not yet compose a convincing operating set |
| HUD / UI | 3 | Truth and next-step copy are explicit, but hierarchy is developer-oriented and occupies nearly half the world view |
| World density | 4 | Campus rhythm is credible; empty apron/interior/acreage and crude hills weaken commercial density |

Baseline verdict: functionally strong adoption proof, visibly pre-production.
Passing tests do not make the current Unity presentation commercially acceptable.

### Baseline architecture findings

- `bridge/protocol.ts` hashes a hand-curated field-name descriptor rather than a
  complete machine-readable schema with field types, requiredness, nullability,
  enums, and `additionalProperties` policy.
- Unity manually mirrors approximately 42 DTO classes across
  `StudioBridgeProtocol.cs` and `StudioLotSnapshot.cs`.
- Concrete drift exists: several root fields are not represented in Unity,
  `currentCommand` is omitted, and an unused Unity load-response DTO does not
  match the flattened TypeScript response.
- No deterministic generator, generated-file verification, or CI drift gate
  exists.
- The current snapshot is one Three.js-oriented monolith of roughly 18 to 21 KB.
- Command IDs, session IDs, expected revisions, stale rejection, exact opaque
  intent IDs, and a 256-entry response replay cache already work.
- The response replay cache silently evicts old command IDs, so sufficiently old
  IDs can eventually be reused.
- Rejections have codes and messages but no structured player remedy.
- Bridge save state is process memory only; restart loses session, revision,
  replay cache, and saved JSON.
- The bridge binds only to `127.0.0.1`, which is correct, but uses a fixed/manual
  port and lacks process lifecycle, graceful shutdown, port discovery, persisted
  logs, stale-process cleanup, and an integrated launcher.

### Known baseline warnings

- `npm ci` reports 6 dependency advisories. Do not run `npm audit fix --force`;
  assess direct reachability and upgrade impact deliberately.
- Vite emits existing bundle-size warnings above 500 KB.
- React tests emit pre-existing `act(...)` warnings and one expected jsdom canvas
  not-implemented warning while still passing.
- A first clean Unity Library import produced transient glTFast character-import
  job errors. A native build and a second 11/11 run were clean. Do not remove or
  replace provenance-cleared assets based only on that transient log.

## Accepted commits

| Repository | SHA | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript | `82c9486a6ce3a849d72c7f7f5258d6392cc3483a` | Exact architecture decision incorporated into campaign boot state |
| Unity | `75706567fa9895892a88310a494158069b70aeda` | Clean-import URP serialization and ignored local evidence root |

The TypeScript continuity-document checkpoint commit that contains this ledger
is the campaign branch tip after Checkpoint 1; resolve it with `git rev-parse
HEAD` because a Git commit cannot embed its own final SHA.

## Next acceptance gate

Phase A1: replace hand-maintained cross-language DTO drift with one complete,
TypeScript-owned canonical schema and deterministic generated C# contract, then
make generated-file verification part of normal validation on both sides.
